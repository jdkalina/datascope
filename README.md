# datascope

The goal of this folder is to show how to connect to the Datascope API and some examples of how to manipulate the data for different purposes. 

The fullholdings.py file shows an example of using the Full Holdings template in Datascope Select to find the holdings within ETFs and Mutual Funds.

The workflow also shows an example of pairing this data with your holdings to measure the risk of your portfolio to specific factors like country, FX, industry and economic regions.
